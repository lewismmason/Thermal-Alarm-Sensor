# Thermal-Alarm-Sensor
A temperature sensor that sets an alarm off when over the set-temperature.

This project works with a SD1602H LCD and AT89LP51RC2 Microcontroller. Actively works like a heat-alarm, setting of a noise when the temperature is at dangerous levels and warning you when close to this temperature. This also allows the user to determine the max and min temperature between two seperate button presses. The Microcontroller interacts with Python and plots a time vs temperature graph, and prints the average tempurature in the command window.
